## Related Repositories

The Academy platform is composed of multiple repositories, each with a specific role:

- **[`academy-theme`](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-theme)** â€“ Controls the siteâ€™s layout, styles, typography, and shortcodes. Included automatically via Go modules.  
- **[`academy-example`](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-example)** â€“ Starter template for organizations to create their own content repositories following Academy standards.  
- **[`academy-build`](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-build)** â€“ Central build and deployment pipeline. Aggregates content from multiple repos with the theme to generate and publish the complete Academy site.

## Quick Start (Local Preview)

> Use this workflow for a fast preview loop when editing Markdown content.

```bash
# Clean up and verify Go module dependencies
go mod tidy

# Install necessary tools and modules
make setup

# Start the local Hugo development server
make site

```

Open your browser at: ```http://localhost:1313/academy```. Note: The local preview uses the ```academy-theme```. In production, content is wrapped by the Layer5 Cloud UI, so minor visual differences may occur. For end-to-end validation, test with the ```academy-build``` repository.

## Publishing

- **Official content**: Merged changes are automatically integrated into the central academy-build pipeline and deployed to the Academy platform.
- **Organization-owned content**: Use academy-example as a starting point.
After creating a release, the academy-build pipeline will fetch and publish your content to Layer5 Cloud (requires organization ID and token).
