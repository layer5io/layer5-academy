## Objective
A challenge to help you set up KEDA and start using it to build real-life applications with event-driven autoscaling in Kubernetes. Learn how to configure KEDA as an autoscaling solution, enabling your workloads to scale based on external metrics such as message queue length, database size, or custom application metrics.

## Prerequisites

**Access to Meshery**: 
You will need access to a Meshery server, either Self-Hosted or the [Meshery Playground](https://playground.meshery.io/).

**Learn KEDA Concepts**: Study [KEDA's key concepts](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/scaling-cloud-native-applications-with-keda-lfel1014/course-introduction/course-information?page=1), including ScaledObjects, ScaledJobs, and various scalers. The Linux Foundation course provides a comprehensive introduction to these concepts, which are essential for completing the challenge successfully.
**Learn to use Meshery**: Go through the Mastering Meshery Learning Path to gain proficiency in using Meshery for designing, deploying, and managing your KEDA-based architecture.
