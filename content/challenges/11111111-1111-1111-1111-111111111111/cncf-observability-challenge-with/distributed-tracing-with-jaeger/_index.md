## Objective

A course to help you setup a service-mesh and start using it to build real-life applications using Meshery
as the cloud native management plane.

## Prerequisites

[**Install Jaeger**:](https://www.jaegertracing.io)
Jaeger maps the flow of requests and data as they traverse a distributed system. These requests may make calls to multiple services, which may introduce their own delays or errors.

**Run Jaeger**:
Your applications must be instrumented before they can send tracing data to Jaeger backend. Check the Client Libraries section for information about how to use the OpenTracing API and how to initialize and configure Jaeger tracers.

**Manage Jaeger**:
Wrangle your cluster and design with Jaeger.
