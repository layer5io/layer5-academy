In this exercise, we will deploy a sample application in Kubernetes and access it.

1. Create webapp.yaml file with contents below.
This file defines a Kubernetes deployment for your Sample Application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
```

1. Deploy the application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webapp.yaml
```

1. Verify the deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
webapp 2/2 2 2 89s
```

1. Set up port forwarding to access the application.
In this step, we are establishing a port forwarding rule that redirects network traffic from a specific port on your
local machine to the corresponding port on the Kubernetes pod hosting the server. By doing so, you enable
direct access to the server via <http://localhost:8080> from your local computer. This action bridges the
network gap between your local environment and the isolated Kubernetes pod, allowing you to test and interact
with the deployed application as if it were running locally. It's important to run this in a new terminal tab to
keep the port forwarding active throughout your testing session.

```bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/webapp 8080:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80
```

1. Test the sample application by sending an HTTP request.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
<Output Truncated>
```

1. Cleanup by deleting the deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete deploy webapp
```
