1. Now that we have installed and verified D```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container a```

99. We have exposed the container on port 8080 of the localhost; let's access the application.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ curl localhost:8080
```

Output:

```htmle have exposed the container on port 8080 of the localhost; let's access the application.

```bashh c59dd04833466e
```

Output:

```bash
root@c59dd0483346:/#
Note: This time we will press ctrl+p,ctrl+q to send the container to
background.
root@c59dd0483346:/# read escape sequence
student@ubuntu:~$
```

8. Let's start an nginx web server and expose a port on the host to access the application. We will also
make use of additional options like --name to name our container:
Let's create our first container. This command pulls the hello-world image from Docker Hub and runs it as a container.


```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container run hello-world
```

Output:

```bash
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
(amd64)
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent
it
to your terminal.
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
https://hub.docker.com/
For more examples and ideas, visit:
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

2. List the container running on our host, by executing the following command:

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container ls
```

Output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
Note: No container is listed, that is because “docker container ls” command
only lists running container by default.
```

3. List the containers running on our host again, by specifying a different option:

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container ls -a
```

Output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS
PORTS NAMES
212315cf9ce9 hello-world "/hello" 4 minutes ago Exited (0) 4 minutes
ago epic_feynman
```

4. In order to know all the options and get help from Docker, we can execute the following command:

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container ls --help
```

Output:

```bash
Usage: docker container ls [OPTIONS]
List containers
Aliases:
docker container ls, docker container list, docker container ps, docker ps
Options:
-a, --all Show all containers (default shows just running)
-f, --filter filter Filter output based on conditions provided
--format string Format output using a custom template:
'table': Print output in table format
with column headers (default)
'table TEMPLATE': Print output in table format
using the given Go template
'json': Print in JSON format
'TEMPLATE': Print output using the given Go
template.
Refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/formatting/ for
more information about formatting output with templates
-n, --last int Show n last created containers (includes all states)
(default -1)
-l, --latest Show the latest created container (includes all
states)
--no-trunc Don't truncate output
-q, --quiet Only display container IDs
-s, --size Display total file sizes
```

5. Interact with a running container. This command starts up an ubuntu container and opens an
interactive bash shell in the foreground:

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Output:

```bash
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
a48641193673: Pull complete
Digest:
sha256:6042500cf4b44023ea1894effe7890666b0c5c7871ed83a97c36c76ae560bb9b
Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
root@8bbf327d2b32:/#
Note: Press exit to close the container shell.
```

6. Start an ubuntu container, but this time we will send the container to the background:

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container run -dit ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Output:

```bash
c59dd04833466ee4aee856b574d918c7a3368b87b9ac7ca70b4ca9800555a33c
```

7. Now that the container is running in the background, we can interact with it by attaching to the container.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container attach c59dd04833466e
root@c59dd0483346:/#
Note: This time we will press ctrl+p,ctrl+q to send the container to
background.
root@c59dd0483346:/# read escape sequence
student@ubuntu:~$
```

8. Let’s start an nginx web server and expose a port on the host to access the application. We will also
make use of additional options like --name to name our container:
```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container run -dit --name webserver -p 8080:80
nginx
```

Output:

```bash
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally

```

9. We have exposed the container on port 8080 of the localhost; let’s access the application.
```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ curl localhost:8080

```

10. Create a custom html page and copy it to our container.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ cat > index.html << EOF
> Welcome to Docker Training!!
> EOF
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container cp index.html
webserver:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

Output:

```bash
Successfully copied 2.05kB to webserver:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

11. Access the application; we should now see the default page changed by our copy command.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ curl localhost:8080
```

Output:

```bash
Welcome to Docker Training!!
```

12. Stop and remove the container.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container stop webserver
```

Output:

```bash
webserver
```

13. Remove all the stopped and completed containers.

```bash
student@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker container prune
```

Output:

```bash
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

14. There are additional container run options; explore the sudo docker container --help command
and try additional options.
