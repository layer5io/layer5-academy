### The DevOps Era
DevOps software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, didn't appear overnight. Its roots can be traced back to several contributing factors and key turning points.

#### Early Influences
- Agile movement: The Agile movement, emerging in the 1990s and formally established in 2001, emphasized iterative development and collaboration, paving the way for DevOps' focus on faster delivery and team integration.
- Automation: The rise of automation tools throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) simplified manual tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-level activities.
- Cloud computing: The emergence of cloud platforms provided a scalable and flexible environment for development and deployment, further facilitating collaboration and faster delivery.

#### Formative Years (2007-2009)
- Patrick Debois: In 2007, frustrated with the traditional silos between development and operations, Patrick Debois, a Belgian consultant and project manager, began advocating for closer collaboration. He coined the term "DevOps" in 2009, which resonated with the growing desire for a more integrated approach to software development. To learn more, you can read "The Origins of DevOps: What's in a Name?" article, by Steve Mezak or watch "The (Short) History of DevOps" video.
- Agile Infrastructure: Around the same time, the "Agile Infrastructure" movement emerged, focusing on applying Agile principles to infrastructure management, aligning it with development practices.

#### Gaining Momentum (2010s)
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): The adoption of CI/CD practices became instrumental in accelerating software delivery and improving feedback loops between development and operations.
- DevOps tools and platforms: A surge of specialized DevOps tools and platforms emerged, automating tasks and providing shared visibility throughout the SDLC.
- Increased awareness and adoption: DevOps became a popular topic in conferences and publications, leading to increased awareness and adoption across various industries.

#### Continuous Evolution (Present Day)
- DevOps continues to evolve: As technology and business needs change, new DevOps practices and tools emerge, focusing on areas like security, compliance, and automation in cloud environments.
- Shift towards DevOps culture: The focus expands beyond tools and processes to create a collaborative culture that fosters communication, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement.
