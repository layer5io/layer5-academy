Observability is a critical aspect of both DevOps (Development and Operations) and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices, as it plays a key role in ensuring the reliability, performance, and efficient operation of modern, complex systems. Here's how observability is integrated into DevOps and SRE.

#### **Observability in DevOps:**
Continuous Monitoring:

- Objective: DevOps emphasizes continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and continuous monitoring. Observability is integrated into the monitoring phase to provide real-time insights into the health and performance of applications.
- Role: DevOps teams use observability tools to monitor application metrics, logs, and traces, enabling them to detect and address issues quickly.

Feedback Loops:

- Objective: DevOps practices involve shortening feedback loops to facilitate rapid iteration and improvement. Observability contributes to these feedback loops by providing actionable insights into the impact of changes on the system.
- Role: Developers receive feedback on how code changes affect system behavior, helping them make informed decisions and improvements.

Collaboration Across Teams:

- Objective: DevOps encourages collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders. Observability tools provide a common language and platform for different teams to share insights and work together to resolve issues.
- Role: Observability fosters a culture of shared responsibility, where developers and operations teams collaborate on identifying and resolving issues.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

- Objective: DevOps promotes the use of Infrastructure as Code for consistent and automated infrastructure management. Observability is integrated into IaC to monitor and analyze the impact of infrastructure changes.
- Role: Observability helps assess the performance and reliability of infrastructure changes, ensuring that they meet operational requirements.

#### **Observability in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**
In both DevOps and SRE practices, observability is not just about monitoring; it's about understanding the entire system's behavior, from application code to infrastructure, and leveraging that understanding to ensure reliability, efficiency, and continuous improvement. Observability practices align closely with the principles of these methodologies, supporting collaboration, automation, and a focus on delivering reliable services to end-users.

Understanding Service Level Agreement (SLA), Service Level Objective (SLO) and Service Level Indicator (SLI) is crucial in the field of cloud native technologies and observability. These concepts are fundamental to ensuring that services meet their performance and reliability targets, which is critical for maintaining user satisfaction and operational excellence. These concepts are not isolated elements but rather a collaborative framework. By effectively utilizing SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, and Observability, you can ensure your software systems deliver on their promises, maintain user trust, and thrive in a competitive landscape. We will discuss SLAs, SLIs and SLOs in the next chapter.
