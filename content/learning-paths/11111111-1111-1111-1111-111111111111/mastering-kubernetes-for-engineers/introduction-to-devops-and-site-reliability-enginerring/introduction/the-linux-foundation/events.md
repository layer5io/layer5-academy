Over 85,000 open source technologists and leaders worldwide gather at Linux Foundation events annually to share ideas, learn and collaborate. Linux Foundation events are the meeting place of choice for open source maintainers, developers, architects, infrastructure managers, and sysadmins and technologists leading open source program offices, and other critical leadership functions.

These events are the best place to gain visibility within the open source community quickly and advance open source development work by forming connections with the people evaluating and creating the next generation of technology. They provide a forum to share and gain knowledge, help organizations identify software trends early to inform future technology investments, connect employers with talent, and showcase technologies and services to influential open source professionals, media, and analysts around the globe.
