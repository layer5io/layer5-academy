### Deploy Node.js Application

1. Clone [this](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git) repo and cd into **quickstarts/tutorials/hello-kubernetes/deploy** directory to get the Node.js and Python YAML files.
2. Import the Node.js application into Meshery.

{{< meshery-design-embed src="embedded-design-node-application.js" id="embedded-design-13665e6e-53cc-4cf4-9e8e-280237428672" >}}

The Dapr annotations in the manifest file will let the Dapr sidecar injector know that it is supposed to inject a sidecar container into this pod during creation.

```yaml
annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "nodeapp"
        dapr.io/app-port: "3000"
        dapr.io/enable-api-logging: "true"
```

3. Click the **Actions** button and deploy.

### Deploy Python Application

Follow previous steps to import and Deploy the python application.

Switch to visualizer and filter according to these specifications:

- For **View Selector** select **Single Namespace**.
- For **Kinds** select the resources you want to see including _Deployments, Pods, Services, Replicaset_.
- For **Labels** select _app=node_ and _app=python_.

You should see the daprd sidecar containers in both the python and node pods.
