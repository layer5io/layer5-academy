This lab provides practical experience of creating a Google Cloud Compute Engine VM. There are different public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. In our lab we will use GCP.
Creating and consuming the infrastructure is similar across different cloud providers with a few vendor-specific differences. In this exercise we will learn how to create a Google Cloud Compute Engine (Virtual Machine).

### Pre-Requisites

Ensure you have a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account. If not, create an account on Google Cloud; new customers get 300$ free credits to evaluate, run, test and deploy workloads.
