### Welcome

This course provides an introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and explores its advantages over traditional manual infrastructure provisioning methods. Focusing on the open source IaC tool OpenTofu, you'll gain insight into how it enables IT professionals to automate infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and management while maintaining vendor neutrality and embracing open collaboration. Through hands-on learning, you'll understand how OpenTofu works, the essential tools required, and its workflow. Youâ€™ll also learn to write a simple OpenTofu configuration file to provision and destroy infrastructure, gaining practical experience with this innovative tool.

Whether you're new to IaC or looking to enhance your skills with an open source alternative, this course will empower you to modernize infrastructure management practices and contribute to the growing OpenTofu ecosystem.
