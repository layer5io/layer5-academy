In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience installing Terraform - an infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud. We will provision a Google Compute Engine using Terraform and then move on to implementing OpenTofu, which is a fork of Terraform that is open source, community-driven, and managed by the Linux Foundation.

### Pre-Requisites

Ensure you have an Ubuntu 20.04 host. If not, then provision a virtual machine from Google Cloud Platform as per the lab in chapter 3.
