In this chapter, we explore the world of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, delving into their fundamental characteristics and impact on modern software development. We begin by reviewing the core features that define these tools, emphasizing concepts such as declarative configuration, idempotent operations, version control integration, dependency management, and parallel execution.

The chapter continues with real-world examples, illustrating how IaC tools streamline infrastructure provisioning, enhance collaboration, and ensure consistent and reproducible environments. We examine the importance of version control in IaC, drawing parallels between code repositories and the evolving landscape of infrastructure configurations.

A spotlight is cast on three prominent IaC tools: Terraform, OpenTofu, and AWS CloudFormation. Terraform, with its declarative syntax, is a versatile choice for multi-cloud provisioning. OpenTofu, a truly open source, community-driven, modular, and backwards-compatible tool which is a fork of Terraform showcases both the imperative and declarative approach, allowing users to define the sequence of operations while also specifying the desired end state of the infrastructure. Meanwhile, AWS CloudFormation, deeply integrated with Amazon Web Services, provides native support for orchestrating cloud resources.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Discuss the meaning and importance of IaC tools
- Explain the characteristics of IaC tools
- List popular IaC tools available on the cloud native space
