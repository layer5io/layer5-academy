This lab provides practical experience installing Docker and Podman and setting up a Kubernetes cluster using kind. Once we have installed the container engine, we will understand the most commonly used container lifecycle operations and move on to build a container image using Dockerfile. We will uninstall Docker and install Podman to understand the Docker alternate tool. While there are many ways in which we can set up a Kubernetes cluster, we will use a simple method of setting up the cluster using kind.

#### Pre-Requisites
Ensure you have an Ubuntu 20.04 host. You can follow the previous lab to provision a virtual machine for yourself.
