In this exercise, we will install Docker and understand the most commonly used container lifecycle commands
and then build an image using Dockerfile.

We can install Docker using the Docker’s apt repository, or install it manually, or use a convenient script
provided by Docker. For simplicity’s sake, we will use the below method.

1. Install Docker:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

2. Enable Docker to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

3. Check that the Docker service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

4. Add current user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

5. Refresh shell session (by exiting & logging in again).
6. Verify the Docker installation:

```bash
docker ps
```
