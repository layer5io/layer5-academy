### Control Plane Node

Control plane nodes in Kubernetes play a critical role in managing the cluster's state and configuration. They are responsible for making global decisions about the cluster (like scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (like starting up a new pod when a deployment's **replicas** field is unsatisfied). Here are the key components of control plane nodes:

- API Server

    Serves as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. The API server is responsible for handling requests, validating them, and updating the corresponding objects in the cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API.

- Cluster Data Store – etcd

    It’s the only stateful part of the cluster which persists the entire cluster configuration aka desired state and the current state of the cluster.

- Controller Manager

    Manages controllers that regulate the state of the cluster. Controllers are responsible for maintaining the desired state and handling tasks like node management, replication, and endpoints.

- Scheduler

    Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability, constraints, and other policies. The scheduler makes decisions to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed across the cluster.

### Worker Node (Minion)

Worker nodes in Kubernetes are the machines (physical or virtual) where your actual applications (containers) run. They are managed by the control plane and perform the requested, necessary workloads. Each worker node is a part of the Kubernetes cluster and has the necessary components to orchestrate and run applications. Here are the key components of a worker node:

- Kubelet

    An agent running on each node that communicates with the control plane node's API server. It ensures that containers are running in a pod and reports back to the control plane about the node's status.

- Container Runtime

    Responsible for managing the entire container lifecycle on the node. Containerd is one of the leading container runtimes.

- Kube Proxy

    It is a Kubernetes agent installed on every node in the cluster. It is responsible for local cluster networking. It implements local IPTABLES or IPVS rules to handle routing and load-balancing of traffic on the Pod network. It monitors the changes that happen to Service objects and their endpoints. If changes occur, it translates them into actual network rules inside the node. Kube-Proxy is installed as an add-on during the installation process, usually created as a DaemonSet.

### Pod

    A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster. Pods encapsulate one or more containers and share network and storage resources.

### ReplicaSet

Manages the lifecycle of pods and ensures that a specified number of replicas for a pod are running at all times. It can scale the number of pods up or down based on defined configurations.

### Deployment

Provides declarative updates to applications. Users define the desired state and the deployment controller changes the actual state to match the desired state, facilitating updates and rollbacks.

### Service

Defines a set of pods and a policy to access them. A service allows communication between different sets of pods in the cluster, abstracting the underlying network details.

### Volume

Manages storage and provides data persistence for containers. Volumes can be attached to pods, allowing data to persist across pod restarts.

### Namespace

Provides a way to divide cluster resources into multiple virtual clusters. Namespaces are useful for organizing and isolating resources within a cluster.

### ConfigMap and Secret

ConfigMaps and Secrets are used to manage configuration data and sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys) separately from the application code.

### Kubernetes Dashboard

A web-based UI for visually managing and monitoring the Kubernetes cluster. It provides a graphical representation of various resources and allows users to interact with the cluster.

Understanding the roles and interactions of these components is crucial for effectively deploying and managing containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
