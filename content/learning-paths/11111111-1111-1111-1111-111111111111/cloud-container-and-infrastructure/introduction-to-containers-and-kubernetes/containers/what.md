Containers have revolutionized Application Packaging and Deployment. In today's fast-paced world, the ability to quickly and efficiently deploy software applications is critical for businesses of all sizes. Containers have emerged as a revolutionary technology that addresses this need by providing a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment for applications to run.

Imagine a container as a standardized box that holds everything your application needs to run - its code, libraries, runtime environment, and system configuration. Unlike virtual machines, which virtualize the entire hardware stack, containers share the underlying operating system (OS) with other containers, making them much more lightweight and efficient.
