### PSN Outage

In April 2011, [the Sony PlayStation Network (PSN) experienced a massive outage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage) that lasted for 23 days and affected over 100 million users. This incident is considered a classic example of the challenges faced in the pre-DevOps era and serves as a cautionary tale for organizations transitioning to modern development practices.

#### Pre-DevOps Challenges Contributing to the PSN Outage

- **Silos and Communication Gaps**: The development and operations teams at Sony worked in separate silos with limited communication and collaboration. This led to a lack of understanding of each other's work and challenges, making it difficult to respond effectively to the evolving situation during the outage.
- **Manual and Slow Processes**: Deployments and infrastructure changes were performed manually, requiring significant time and effort. This slowness hampered Sony's ability to quickly assess the situation and implement necessary fixes.
- **Limited Scalability and Flexibility**: The PSN's infrastructure was not designed to handle the surging demand caused by the attack, leading to widespread outages and service disruptions.
- **Lack of Visibility and Tracking**: Sony lacked effective monitoring tools to identify and diagnose the source of the outage promptly. This delayed the response time and made it difficult to determine the full scope of the attack.
- **Culture of Blame and Finger-Pointing**: The siloed environment and lack of communication led to blame and finger-pointing between different teams, hindering collaboration and problem-solving efforts.

#### Consequences of the PSN Outage

- **Financial Losses**: Sony estimated the outage cost the company approximately $170 million in lost revenue and legal settlements.
- **Reputation Damage**: The incident severely damaged Sony's reputation and eroded user trust in the PSN platform.
- **Customer Frustration**: Millions of users were frustrated by the prolonged outage and lack of information from Sony.

#### Lessons Learned from the PSN Outage

Here are some of the lessons learned from the PSN outage:

- The importance of breaking down silos and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.
- The need for automated deployments and infrastructure changes to enable faster response times.
- The importance of building scalable and flexible infrastructure to handle unexpected spikes in demand.
- The necessity for implementing effective monitoring tools to gain real-time insights into system health and performance.
- The value of building a culture of shared responsibility and collaboration to prevent future incidents.

The Sony PSN outage serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and consequences of operating in the pre-DevOps era. By adopting modern DevOps principles and practices, organizations can avoid similar pitfalls and ensure greater agility, reliability, and security in their operations.
