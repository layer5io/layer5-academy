### Key Characteristics of the Pre-DevOps Era

The pre-DevOps era in software development was a starkly different landscape than what we see today. It was a time of siloed teams, rigid methodologies, and a lot of manual work, which often led to slow and unreliable software delivery.

- **Waterfall Model**
   The dominant methodology was the [Waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), a linear approach where each stage had to be completed before moving on to the next. This made it difficult to adapt to changes and respond quickly to new requirements.
- **Siloed Teams**
   Developers, testers, and operations teams worked independently, often with little communication or collaboration. This created a "throw it over the wall" mentality, where each team blamed the other for problems.
- **Manual Processes**
   Most tasks, from testing to deployment, were done manually. This was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and inconsistencies.
- **Limited Automation**
   There were few tools available to automate repetitive tasks, making it difficult to scale software development.
- **Slow and Unreliable Delivery**
    Releases were infrequent and often buggy, causing frustration for both developers and users.
Next, letâ€™s take a look at some specific examples of the challenges faced in the pre-DevOps era.
