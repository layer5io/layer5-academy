### The Launch of healthcare.gov Website

The launch of the [United States Department of Health and Human Services' healthcare.gov website](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/the-failed-launch-of-www-healthcare-gov/) in 2013 was plagued by technical problems, causing major delays and embarrassment for the government. This was due in part to the use of outdated technology and a lack of collaboration between development and operations teams.

The pre-DevOps era was a time of significant challenges for software development. However, it also laid the groundwork for the emergence of DevOps, which has revolutionized the way software is built and delivered.
