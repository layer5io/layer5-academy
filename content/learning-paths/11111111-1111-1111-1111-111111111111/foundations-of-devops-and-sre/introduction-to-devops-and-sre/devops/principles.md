### Key Principles of DevOps

Adhering to the key principles of DevOps will ensure a more successful development, delivery, and implementation of applications and services.

- **Collaboration**: DevOps emphasizes breaking down silos between development and operations teams, encouraging shared responsibilities and improved communication.

- **Automation**: Automation is a core tenet of DevOps, involving the use of tools to automate manual and repetitive tasks in the software development and delivery pipeline.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers integrate their code into a shared repository multiple times a day, with automated builds and tests to detect and address issues early in the development process.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying code changes to production environments after passing automated tests. This ensures rapid and reliable releases.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.

- **Monitoring and Feedback**: DevOps emphasizes continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure, providing real-time feedback to identify and address issues promptly.
