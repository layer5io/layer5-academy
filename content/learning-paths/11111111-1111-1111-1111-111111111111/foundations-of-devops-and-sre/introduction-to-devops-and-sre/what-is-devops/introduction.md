[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) (Development + Operations) is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal is to automate and streamline the processes of software delivery and infrastructure changes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and faster, more reliable releases.

[Site Reliability Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering), or SRE, is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. It was developed at Google to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.
