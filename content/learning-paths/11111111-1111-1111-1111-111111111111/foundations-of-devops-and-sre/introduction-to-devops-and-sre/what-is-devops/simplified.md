### Overview

DevOps and SRE are two different disciplines of Software Engineering, but they are deeply interconnected and rely on each other for success. DevOps focuses on creating new features and improvements, while SRE focuses on ensuring the reliability and stability of the system. Both DevOps and SRE require strong collaboration and communication to achieve common goals. Anyone interested in a career in tech should consider exploring both DevOps and SRE to understand the full picture of software development and delivery.

In this course, we will provide an understanding of what DevOps and SRE are all about and how they work together to create successful software products. Letâ€™s look at a simplified analogy to understand better.

Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. You're responsible for creating delicious dishes, but you can't do it alone. You need someone to help you gather ingredients, prepare the kitchen, and even clean up afterwards. That's where the kitchen assistant comes in.

DevOps and SRE are like the chef and the kitchen assistant in the tech world.

DevOps (Development + Operations) is the chef, focusing on creating new features and improvements. They're constantly innovating and experimenting, trying out new recipes and cooking techniques.

SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is the kitchen assistant, ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. They're responsible for setting up the kitchen, maintaining the equipment, and creating workflows that make the chef's job easier.

### The DevOps/SRE Analogy


#### New Recipe Development
- **DevOps**: Brainstorms new dishes, experiments with flavors and ingredients, and writes down the recipes (code).
- **SRE**: Sets up the kitchen with all the necessary tools and equipment, creates a clean and organized workspace, and ensures everything is functioning properly.

#### Preparing the Kitchen
- **DevOps**: Gathers ingredients (data), prepares them (cleans and formats the code), and begins the cooking process (testing and deploying the code).
- **SRE**: Manages inventory, ensures ingredients are fresh and available, and monitors the kitchen for any potential issues.

#### Cooking and Serving
- **DevOps**: Continuously monitors the cooking process, makes adjustments as needed, and ensures the dish is cooked to perfection (testing and refining the code).
- **SRE**: Handles any unexpected hiccups or spills, makes sure the kitchen remains clean and organized, and helps the chef deliver the finished dish to customers (users).

#### Cleaning Up
- **DevOps**: Analyzes the finished dish, identifies areas for improvement, and cleans up any leftovers (code or resources).
- **SRE**: Cleans the kitchen, puts away tools and equipment, and prepares for the next round of cooking.

By working together, DevOps and SRE ensure that the restaurant runs smoothly, delicious dishes are consistently cooked and served, and customers are always satisfied.

Before we deep dive into the world of DevOps and SRE, let's look at some of the existing challenges which led to DevOps culture and principles.
