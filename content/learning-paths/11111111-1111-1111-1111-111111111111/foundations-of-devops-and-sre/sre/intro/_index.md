This chapter provides a foundational understanding of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), a discipline that integrates aspects of software engineering into IT operations to create highly reliable and scalable systems. Beginning with its origins and key principles, the chapter delves into the core practices of SRE, including the establishment of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), the importance of automation, and the strategic use of error budgets to balance reliability with the pace of innovation. It outlines the roles and responsibilities within SRE teams, the process of implementing SRE in organizations, and the essential tools and technologies that support SRE practices. Through this comprehensive overview, you will gain insights into how SRE bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring system reliability and efficiency.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Discuss the meaning and importance of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- Discuss Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
- Explore important principles of SRE
