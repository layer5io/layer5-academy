### Continuous Integration (CI) Principles

- **Frequent Code Integration**: Developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently, ensuring that the codebase is continuously evolving in a collaborative manner.

- **Automated Builds**: Every integration triggers an automated build process, including compiling the code, running tests, and creating executable artifacts. Automation ensures consistency and reliability.

- **Automated Testing**: A comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests and integration tests, is run with each integration to detect and address issues early in the development process.

- **Immediate Feedback**: Developers receive immediate feedback on the success or failure of their code integration. Quick feedback allows for prompt issue resolution, reducing the risk of defects accumulating.

### Continuous Integration (CI) Practices

- **Version Control**: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes, enabling collaboration, tracking history, and providing a reliable mechanism for rollbacks.

- **Automated Builds**: Set up automated build processes triggered by code commits. These processes should compile the code, run tests, and produce deployable artifacts.

- **Automated Testing**: Develop and maintain a suite of automated tests to validate the correctness and functionality of the code. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests.

- **Continuous Integration Server**: Employ a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI) to automate the integration and testing process. The CI server monitors the version control system and triggers builds and tests upon code changes.
