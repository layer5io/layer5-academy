Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are practices closely related to Continuous Integration (CI) in the realm of software development. While they share some similarities, each has distinct characteristics that contribute to the overall goal of delivering high-quality software efficiently.

In summary, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are practices that extend the benefits of Continuous Integration. Continuous Delivery emphasizes a reliable and automated process up to the production environment, with human intervention required for the final release decision. On the other hand, Continuous Deployment takes automation further by automatically deploying code changes to production, providing immediate access to new features for end-users. The choice between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment depends on factors such as the organization's risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and the need for human oversight in the release process.
