### Continuous Delivery

[Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles) is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of releasing software changes to production environments in a frequent and reliable manner. It builds upon the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) by extending the automated pipeline to include deployment and release processes. In continuous delivery, the goal is to have software in a state where it can be released to production at any given time.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development approach that combines the practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to automate the entire software delivery pipeline, from code changes to production deployment. A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building images, running tests, and deploying software updates. It minimizes manual errors, provides developer feedback, and enables rapid product iterations.
