### Tools

#### Monitoring and Metrics
**Prometheus** is an open source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets, stores them, and makes them available for querying.

**Grafana** is a popular open source platform for visualizing and analyzing metrics. Grafana integrates with various data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Elasticsearch.

**InfluxDB** is a high-performance, distributed, and scalable time-series database. It is commonly used for storing and querying metrics data.

**Datadog** is a cloud-based observability platform that integrates monitoring, logging, and APM (Application Performance Monitoring) capabilities. It supports a wide range of integrations.


#### Logging
**ELK Stack** stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, Logstash is a log pipeline tool, and Kibana is a visualization platform. Together, they form a powerful stack for log management.

**Splunk** is a widely used platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data, including logs. It provides powerful search and visualization features.

#### Tracing
**Jaeger** is an open source, end-to-end distributed tracing system. It helps in monitoring and troubleshooting the latency of requests in complex, microservices-based architectures.

**Zipkin** is another open source distributed tracing system. Zipkin allows users to trace requests as they travel through various services in a distributed system.

#### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
**New Relic** is a cloud-based APM tool that provides detailed insights into application performance. It offers features like transaction tracing, error tracking, and infrastructure monitoring.

**AppDynamics** is a comprehensive APM solution that provides real-time monitoring of applications, user experience, and infrastructure. It helps in identifying performance bottlenecks.

#### Infrastructure Monitoring
**Nagios** is a widely used open source infrastructure monitoring solution. Nagios can monitor hosts, services, and network devices, providing alerts in case of issues.

**Zabbix** is an open source monitoring solution that offers features for monitoring servers, networks, applications, and services. It supports a range of data visualization options.

#### Cloud Native Observability
**AWS CloudWatch** is Amazon's monitoring and observability service for AWS resources. It provides metrics, logs, and traces for AWS services and applications.

**Azure Monitor** is Microsoft Azure's observability service, offering insights into the performance and health of applications and infrastructure on the Azure platform.

**Meshery** is the cloud native manager for lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. It provides deep observability and performance analysis for cloud native applications.

These tools cater to different aspects of observability, and organizations often use a combination of them to get a comprehensive view of their systems. When selecting observability tools, it's important to consider factors such as the specific needs of the organization, integration capabilities, ease of use, and scalability. Additionally, checking for the most recent updates and community support for these tools is recommended.
