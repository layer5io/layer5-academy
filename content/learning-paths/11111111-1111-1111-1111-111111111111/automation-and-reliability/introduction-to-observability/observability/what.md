Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its external outputs. This means being able to infer what is happening inside the system based on the information it produces, such as logs, metrics, and traces.

Observability is becoming increasingly important in the modern world of software development, where systems are becoming ever more complex and distributed. With traditional monitoring approaches, it can be difficult to understand what is happening inside a system and why it is behaving in a certain way. Observability provides a way to overcome this challenge by giving us a more holistic view of the system.
