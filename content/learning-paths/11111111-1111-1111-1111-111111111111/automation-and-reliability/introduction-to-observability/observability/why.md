### Why?

Observability is a crucial DevOps concept, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability, performance, and overall success of software applications and services. It goes beyond traditional monitoring to offer a comprehensive, real-time insight into the health and behavior of systems. Here are several key reasons why observability is needed in DevOps.

- **Complexity of Modern Systems**: With the rise of microservices architecture, cloud computing, and distributed systems, applications have become more complex. Observability is crucial for understanding and managing this complexity.

- **Faster Incident Resolution**: Observability tools enable quicker detection and resolution of issues. Teams can identify problems, understand their root causes, and implement solutions faster, reducing downtime.

- **Improved User Experience**: By proactively monitoring and analyzing system behavior, teams can enhance the overall user experience by identifying and addressing performance issues before users are affected.

- **Improved Troubleshooting**: Observability can help you to identify and diagnose problems quickly and efficiently. By analyzing logs, metrics, and traces, you can pinpoint the root cause of an issue and take corrective action.

- **Enhanced Performance**: Observability can help you optimize the performance of your system by identifying bottlenecks and resource constraints.

- **Reduced Costs**: By proactively identifying and resolving issues, observability can help you reduce the cost of downtime and lost productivity.
